========

This is my personal website. Includes Skills, Experience, Blog and pages generated by Jekyll. Hosted on GitHub.

To make this website I learned HTML and CSS through Jonathan McGlone's Guide, W3Schools Online Web Tutorial, and various Google searches. I also received very useful tips from Karen Kong.

## Resources
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - [Jonathan McGlone's Guide To Hosting A Personal Website On Github](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
  - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  - [Set Up Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508)
  - [Karen Kong's Github](https://github.com/kkong006)

**NOTE:** If you fork or re-use this project, please be sure you:

* Edit `_includes/analytics.html` and either
  * Replace the Google Analytics tracking code with your own, or
  * If you don't use Google Analytics, comment the block of code out entirely.

Otherwise I will receive Google Analytics data from your website.
