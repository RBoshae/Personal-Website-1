              <a href="https://projecteuler.net/"> ProjectEuler.net </a> is an excellent site that hosts a number of math problems designed to be solved by a computer aka let's program! Here is a list of solutions I've compiled. For some solutions, I have discuss my approach. I may also offer suggestions for a clever approach to the problem. You're welcome to attempt the problem yourself or verify your answer by browsing the page.

            <h2>Problem 1</h2>
            <h3>Multiples of 3 and 5</h3>
            <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
            <p>Find the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000.</p>
